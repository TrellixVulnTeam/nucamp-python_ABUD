# nucamp-python

Welcome to my Nucamp Python Bootcamp Repository! 

This repository contains all of the assignments, exercises, notes, and projects that I've completed throughout my 16-week journey of backend fundamentals,
SQL, and DevOps with Python. 

My first ever text-based battle game can be found [here](https://github.com/ericdwkim/nucamp-python/blob/0f14b1f4cc09585e1df0cf23c1faf6595f8792d7/Python/1-Fundamentals/portfolio_project/app.py). 

My Spotify clone project can be found [here](https://github.com/ericdwkim/SpotifyMe).

Thank you for visiting my first ever public repository. Wish me luck on my developer journey! :)
