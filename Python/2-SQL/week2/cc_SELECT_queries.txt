my attempt:

SELECT company_name FROM customers
WHERE company_name LIKE 'Q' BETWEEN 'Z'
ORDER BY company_name DESC;

solution/answer:

SELECT company_name FROM customers 
WHERE company_name >= 'Q' ORDER BY company_name DESC;

// makes sense since alphabet is probably mapped to numbers in backend code from
// 1 - 26, so defining WHERE clause as >= 'Q' sets it from >= 16 .... -> 26 inclusive

my attempt:

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Representative'
ORDER BY last_name;

solution/answer:

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Representative'
ORDER BY last_name, first_name;

Question: "sort by last_name, and within the same last name, sort by first_name"
         da fuck does that last part mean?!!

my attempt:

SELECT first_name, home_phone FROM employees
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%', home_phone LIKE '%4%'
ORDER BY employee_id;

solution/answer:

SELECT first_name, home_phone FROM employees 
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%' AND home_phone LIKE '%4%' 
ORDER BY employee_id;

// makes sense to use logical operator `AND` so that both conditional expressions
// must evaluate to TRUE for the query to be successful; using a comma would make it
// a tuple (question?)
