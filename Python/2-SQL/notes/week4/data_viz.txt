 NumPy provides tools for working with numbers such as the ndarray object (an n-dimensional array), 
 but it is not itself a graphing library. 
 It is used in conjunction with other libraries such as MatPlotLib, which do create graphs. 

Pandas is a Python library that provides tools for data manipulation 
and visualization from tabular data, such as SQL databases.
