- used to form temporary result sets, called Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- breaks down complex queries into simpler parts
- based query can leverage data in temporary Table
- does not create new table, table cleared from memory after query is completed

Syntax example:

WITH temporary_table_name AS (
    nested_query
)
base_query;
---------------------------------

WITH example "for the top sales regions (top 10% in total sales), 
find the total units sold and the total sales for each product":

WITH regional_sales AS (
    SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY region
), top_regions AS (
    SELECT region
    FROM regional_sales
    WHERE total_sales > (SELECT SUM(total_sales)/10 FROM regional_sales)
)
SELECT region,
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS product_units,
    SUM(amount) AS product_sales
FROM orders
WHERE region IN (SELECT region FROM top_regions)
GROUP BY region, product;
