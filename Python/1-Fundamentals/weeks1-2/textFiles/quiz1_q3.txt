What will the output of the following while loop be?

x = 0
while x < 10:
    x = x+1
    if x == 1:
        print("small")
    if x > 2:
        x = x+1
        print("medium")
    if x == 5:
        x = 7
        print("big")
        

x = 0; small
x = 1; N/A
x = 2; medium
x = 3; medium
x = 7; medium
x = 8; medium
